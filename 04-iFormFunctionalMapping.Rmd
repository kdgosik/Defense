# iForm Functional Mapping (A computational method)


## Motivation

Treating the molecular biology of an organisim as a complex trait, it would be likely that the expression profiles of certain genes, proteins or other metabolites would follow a more functional or dynamic phenotype. This information could be lost or greatly limited by treating the response as a single static predictor. In an attempt to capture all relevant information available I am currently extending the procedure further to include the entire growth function as a phenotype. The mean growth curve is estimated for the sample and then orthogonal polynomials are used to assist in fitting the genetic effects for each marker or interaction between the markers. This would allow the genetic effect some flexibility over time and give a more representative fit. I anticipate submitting a third manuscript in late spring around this topic. This could also be used with other semi parametric functions to model dynamics or other types of non-linear functions that characterizes the biological systems being evaluated.


### Update
  (This is from Han Hao's proposal, update for yours) 

Changes in developmental timing and rate, named as heterochrony, have long
been believed to be a major force in the evolution of phenotype (Gould, 1977;
Wilson et al., 1988). It has been observed that relatively few genetic changes
in heterochrony through the endocrine regulation of metamorphosis can cause
profound morphological consequences (Moss, 2007). For example, although humans
and chimpanzees are closely related, their skull shape and brain growth are different
dramatically during early development (Rice, 2002; Mitteroecker et al., 2004; King,
2004). A recent phylogenic investigation revealed that changes in developmental
timing are a crucial step for birds to evolve from dinosaurs (Bhullar, 2012). The
consequence of these changes leads birds to take months to reach sexual maturity,
allowing them to retain the physical characteristics of baby stages characterized by dinosaurs that take years to mature. One question that naturally arises from these
evolutionary divergences is what mechanisms are implicated for heterochrony and
the change of biological clock.


Many studies have pursued to identify the molecular control of developmental
timing; mostly using Caenorhabditis elegans as an example, these studies have
identified heterochronic genes that orchestrate the timing of cell divisions and fates
during development regulated by microRNAs and their targets (Ambros, 2000;
Rougvie, 2001; Pasquinelli and Ruvkun, 2002; Banerjee and Slack, 2002; Moss, 2007).
Focusing on particular pathways causing heterochonic changes, none of these studies
has provided an entire picture of the genetic control of heterochrnoy. Furthermore,
the effects of heterochronic genes on the evolution of complex phenotypes have not
been quantified, limiting the inference and prediction of evolutionary changes.


In this chapter, we develop a general framework for characterizing the genetic
architecture of heterochrony based on widely used genetic mapping approaches.
Genetic mapping has been proved to be powerful for mapping and studying quantitative
trait loci (QTLs) involved in complex traits (Lander and Botstein, 1986),
and has been increasingly integrated with network biology to better elucidate the
mechanisms of the way QTL acts and interacts with other factors (Wang et al.,
2012b). In the decade, genetic mapping has developed to a point at which this
approach can characterize QTLs that control the process of development, leading
to the birth of functional mapping (Ma et al., 2002; Wu and Lin, 2006; Li and
Wu, 2010). Functional mapping implements mathematical aspects of developmental
principles into a mapping framework, equipped with a capacity to study the
interplay between QTLs and development. Here, we extend functional mapping
to characterize QTLs controlling heterochrony (named hQTLs), specified by three
parameters (i) the onset of a particular process, (ii) its offset, and (iii) the rate at which the process proceeds. By using growth equation as an example, we exemplify the procedure of model derivations as well as the practical use of the model in hQTL detection. In the end, we discuss an issue of how hQTLs can be integrated
with developmental evolutionary biology (evo-devo), a fast-growing discipline of
biology in the recent years.

## Methods

### Functional Mapping

#### Update
  (This is from Han Hao's proposal, update for yours)
  
Functional mapping is a group of methods used for mapping QTLs related to
functional valued traits that are measured over a certain time period. These
function-valued traits are widely seen in growth analysis, shape analysis, network
analysis, and clinical trials. By integrating functional features with genetic analysis,
functional mapping methods often help to increase the statistical power and the
biological relevance between the detected QTLs and biological traits. Functional
mapping methods were first developed using parametric curves to describe the
functional valued traits, such as growth curves or pharmacodynamic models (Ma
et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2005). Later, semi-parametric and non-parametric models
were introduced for complex traits that do not have specific mathematical forms
(Das et al., 2011, 2013).


The key of functional mapping methods is the modelling of both functional means
and the covariance structure across measurements from the same individual. When
modelling the functional means, biological background is first examined to select
the best function, either parametric or non-parametric. The covariance structure is
usually modeled by parsimonious and flexible approaches such as autoregressive, antedependence, or nonparametric structures. The functional means and covariance
structures can be integrated into a likelihood function, then hypothesis testing can
be performed with a likelihood ratio testing approach.

Similarly, following the classical BIC rule (Swartz 1978), we can define the BIC rule for the cubic MESS model as

$$BIC(\lambda, \lambda_v ) = -2*LogLik + log(n)*(df + df_v)$$
n is the number of subjects
$$\lambda = smoothing paramter$$
$$\lambda_v = smoothing paramter, number of knots in the cubic spline$$

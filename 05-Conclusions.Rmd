# Conclusions

** research statement **
Continuing on, my aim would be to work with datasets of this scale and incorporate the types of statistical methods mentioned and machine learning techniques to aid in analysis. The results could help gain larger insights into the genomic/epigenetic architecture of biological systems. On top of the importance of a functional component to the phenotype, considering other types of multivariate responses would be interesting to study in context of such a system. Integrating different level of omics data and the challenges that arise with such complicated and large datasets has interested me throughout my PhD work. Translating such a complex system into usable information that can be shared in order to prevent and fight disease would be ideal research for me. This type of research would need both methodological development as well as application of existing statistical and machine/deep learning techniques to handle the magnitude of the problem.


## Summary

applied, adapted and extended the forward selection procedure under the marginality assumption first proposed by \cite{hao2014interaction}

able to reduce search space substantially by making some reasonable assumptions about the data.  These assumptions can be relaxed a little to broaden the scope of the space.



advantages

computationally efficient way for high dimensional data situations that arise from high throughput data, especially when considering epstasis between gene markers or other type of interaction effects in the model.  Guided search space based off of commonly used principles in model selection that are relevant in real world situations.  Able to perform a GWAS with included epistatic interactions a fairly quick manner.  Able to relax assumptions to widen the search space.  This may decrease the speed of the algorithm but makes the search more comprehensive.  Able to screen for complex scenarios that would be hard to find in a lab setting otherwise.  Having said that with the flexiblity of the initial model, false posiive rates could be a concern and need to be taken into consideration.  Adjustement to the significance level and the model selection criteria have been made to account for this.  This would still need to be followed up on independtly by checking with other datasets and/or lab verification.  

Functional componenets were also considered to such a selection procedure.  This also increases the computational complexity of the model and therefore decreases some efficeiency gains previously seen.  Use biologically relevant information to guide the fitting of the model.  Initially considers well established growth equations as a baseline for the underlying structure.  It then performs a GWAS level analysis with considering epstatic interactions throughout the process.  




## Discussion

complex and many moving parts to the selection procedure.  Very flexible but this could have it be prone to over fitting at times if not well controlled.  Need to heavily consider this as part of interpretating the model.  Mainly used a screening to guide future research.  

With the complexity and expense that comes with genetic mapping, espically with a functional trait that needs repeated measuresUsed as a screening tool for initial findings and exploratory data analysis to aid and guide future research.  Needs to be then be lab validated.  Especially with something as intricate as epistatic effects between gene markers.

Further investigations are needed to confirm or modify our findings by QTL mapping in natural populations.


__BIC Limitations (wikipedia)__
the above approximation is only valid for sample size n much larger than the number k of parameters in the model.

the BIC cannot handle complex collections of models as in the variable selection (or feature selection) problem in high-dimension.[3]





## Future Steps

### Aim 1

incorporate other mean curves for intercept term
Other types of orthogonal polynomials
general additive models components

consider different level of interactions and omics data.
gene-environment
methylation


### Aim 2

extend to include multivariate reponses to the system
how to extend selection criteria in this fashion
search space grows even larger
what is defined as the 'best' predictor for 1 reponse might not be for the others

### Aim 3



We have finished a nice book.
